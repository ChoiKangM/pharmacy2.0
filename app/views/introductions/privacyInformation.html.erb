          This Privacy Notice is meant to help G Suite for Education users and parents understand
          what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. This Notice includes
          information about our privacy practices that are specific to G Suite for Education and
          summarizes the most relevant portions of the <a href=
          "https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>, which
          provides additional examples and explanations that may be useful. We hope you will take
          the time to read this Notice and the Google Privacy Policy, which both apply to G Suite
          for Education accounts.
        </p><strong>Information we collect</strong>
        <p>
          A G Suite for Education account is a Google Account created and managed by a school for
          use by students and educators. When creating this account, the school may provide
          Google with certain personal information about its students and educators, which
          includes a user’s name, email address, and password in most cases, but could also
          include secondary email, phone, and address if the school chooses to provide that
          information. Google may also collect personal information directly from users of G
          Suite for Education accounts, such as telephone number, profile photo or other <a href=
          "https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27442?hl=en&amp;visit_id=1-636361886285506712-1123491408&amp;rd=1">
          information</a> they add to a G Suite for Education account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google also collects information based on the use of our services. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>device information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, unique
          device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number of the user;
          </li>
          <li>log information, including details of how a user used our service, device event
          information, and the user's Internet protocol (IP) address;
          </li>
          <li>location information, as determined by various technologies including IP address,
          GPS, and other sensors;
          </li>
          <li>unique application numbers, such as application version number; and
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-cookie">cookies
            or similar technologies</a> which are used to collect and store information about a
            browser or device, such as preferred language and other settings.
          </li>
        </ul><strong>How we use information we collect</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>In G Suite for Education Core Services</strong>
          </li>
          <li>The G Suite for Education Core Services (“Core Services”) are listed in the
            <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en/terms/user_features.html">Services
            Summary</a> and include Gmail, Calendar, Classroom, Contacts, Drive, Docs, Forms,
            Groups, Sheets, Sites, Slides, Talk/Hangouts, Vault, and Chrome Sync. These services
            are provided to a school under its <a href=
            "https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en/terms/education_terms.html">G Suite for Education
            agreement</a> and, as applicable, <a href=
            "https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en/terms/dpa_terms.html">Data Processing
            Amendment</a>. (Users and parents can ask their school if it has accepted the Data
            Processing Amendment.)
          </li>
          <li>User personal information collected in the Core Services is used only to provide
          the Core Services. Google does not serve ads in the Core Services or use personal
          information collected in the Core Services for advertising purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>In Google services generally</strong>
          </li>
          <li>Besides the Core Services, G Suite for Education users may have access to other
          Google services that we make generally available for consumers, such as Google Maps,
          Blogger, and YouTube. We call these “Additional Services” since they are outside of the
          Core Services.
          </li>
          <li>The Google Privacy Policy describes fully <a href=
          "https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/#infouse">how Google services generally use
          information</a>, including for G Suite for Education users. To summarize, we use the
          information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and
          improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Google and our users. We also use
          this information to offer users tailored content, such as more relevant search results.
          We may combine personal information from one service with information, including
          personal information, from other Google services.
          </li>
          <li>Google may serve ads to G Suite for Education users in the Additional Services. For
          G Suite for Education users in primary and secondary (K-12) schools, Google does not
          use any user personal information (or any information associated with a G Suite for
          Education Account) to target ads, whether in Core Services or other Google services
          accessed while using a G Suite for Education account.
          </li>

          Additional Services for G Suite for Education users.
        </p><strong>Information users share</strong>
        <p>
          A school may allow students to access Google services such as Google Docs and Sites,
          which include features where users can share information with others or publicly. When
          users share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines, including
          Google. Our services provide users with various options for <a href=
          "https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/example/sharing.html">sharing</a> and <a href=
          "https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/example/removing-your-content.html">removing
          content</a>.
        </p><strong>Information we share</strong>
        <p>
          Information we collect may be shared outside of Google in limited circumstances. We do
          not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of
          Google unless one of the following circumstances applies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>With user consent.</strong> We will share personal information with
            companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have user consent
            or parents’ consent (as applicable).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>With G Suite for Education administrators.</strong> G Suite for Education
            administrators have access to information stored in the Google Accounts of users in
            that school or domain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>For external processing.</strong> We provide personal information to our
            affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our
            instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate
            confidentiality and security measures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>For legal reasons.</strong> We will share personal information with
            companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith
            belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably
            necessary to:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="unorderedlist-items">
          <ol>
            <li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental
            request.
            </li>
            <li>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential
            violations.
            </li>
            <li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
            </li>
            <li>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or
            the public as required or permitted by law.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may share non-personal information publicly and with our partners – like publishers
          or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about
          the general use of our services.
        </p><strong>Transparency and choice</strong>
        <p>
          We provide a variety of user controls that enable G Suite for Education users to make
          meaningful choices about how information is used in Google services. Depending on the
          settings enabled by the school, users can use the various controls described in the
          <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/#infochoices">Privacy Policy</a>, such
          as <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/privacy?hl=en&amp;pli=1#accounthistory">Google
          activity controls</a>, to manage their privacy and information. We provide additional
          information for parents, students, and administrators on the <a href=
          "https://www.google.com/edu/trust/">G Suite for Education Privacy Center</a>.
        </p><strong>Parental review and deletion of information</strong>
        <p>
          The parents of G Suite for Education users in Primary/Secondary (K-12) schools can
          access their child’s personal information or request that it be deleted through the
          school administrator. School administrators can provide for parental access and
          deletion of personal information consistent with the functionality of our services. If
          a parent wishes to stop any further collection or use of the child's information, the
          parent can request that the administrator use the service controls available to them to
          limit the child’s access to features or services, or delete the child’s account
          entirely. Guidance for administrators on how to use service controls to accomplish this
          is available in the G Suite <a href="https://support.google.com/a">Help Center</a>.
        </p><strong>Interpretation of conflicting terms</strong>
        <p>
          This Notice is intended to provide the key information about our collection and use of
          data for G Suite for Education users, and is consistent with the Google Privacy Policy
          and the G Suite for Education agreement, which provide additional examples and
          explanations that may be useful. Where there are terms that differ, as with the
          limitations on advertising in G Suite for Education, the <a href=
          "https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en/terms/education_terms.html">G Suite for Education
          agreement</a> (as amended) takes precedence, followed by this Privacy Notice and then
          the <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
